# **Quality Text Generator**
===================================
Convert Text to QuAlItY or ALL CAPS formats


## Description
===============================================================================
Quality Text Generator takes a pre-existing text file and creates a new version of the file based off the file selected and the format chosen while it is running.

Before running the Quality Text Generator, the original text file has to be placed in the ifiles directory in order for it to work. Once that has been placed in the ifiles directory, run the QualityTextGenerator executable and select your file.

Once you have selected your file and format, the new Quality version of the file will be generated in the "ofiles" directory.

### TODO:
==========================================
- Add a new vowel-free format to select [x]
- Add output filenames that reflect the format chosen
- Add file format selections to choose from when creating the quality output file
